The customer is the producer
In the customerService the customer publishes the notification trhanks to the service and sends it to the queue

The configurtaion and the declaration of the published service is done in the RabbitMqConfig, where the customer
can use the configurations and can communicate with the queue thanks to the amqTemplate

The NotificationConsumer class is the next step which takes the notification published from the Customer and Listens it.
It takes the notification from the queue and then it can perform its action


Customer (producer) -> JSON ->Exchange->Queue->Binding->Notification (consumes the message from the queue)

The queue must be always populated with values in order to execute the send notification
